# Threads-and-ThreadPool
In computer programming, a thread pool is a software design pattern for achieving concurrency of execution in a computer program.
Often also called a replicated workers or worker-crew model, a thread pool maintains multiple threads waiting for tasks 
to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program. 
By maintaining a pool of threads, the model increases performance and avoids latency in execution due to frequent creation
and destruction of threads for short-lived tasks. The number of available threads is tuned to the computing resources available
to the program, such as a parallel task queue after completion of execution.
